bda.portlet.sitenavigation
==========================

Yet another navigation portlet. This is quite similar to
``collective.portlet.sitemap``, except that there are slightly different
options. Like ``collective.portlet.sitemap``, it optionally allows you to
display the navigation tree expanded, like the sitemap does.

This portlet is also optimized to work in Lineage sites, as it allows you to
root the navigation portlet from the portal root, the navigation root or the
current context.
